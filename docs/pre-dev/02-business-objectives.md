## Strategic Alignment

**Market Position:** First-mover in the "law comprehension" space for Nigeria

**Competitive Strategy:**
- Differentiate on *understanding*, not just *access*
- Target underserved market (non-lawyers) that competitors ignore
- Build moat through user-generated scenario data
- Position for future expansion (state laws, case law, languages)

**Solo Developer Strategy:**
- Leverage AI for content generation (explanations, examples)
- Use managed services to minimize ops burden
- Focus on core differentiator, outsource/defer everything else
- Quality over quantity — fewer laws, better explanations
