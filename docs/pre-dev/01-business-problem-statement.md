# Business Problem Statement

> LawMadeSimple: Democratizing Nigerian law through comprehension, not just access.

---

## Problem Description

**Who experiences this problem?**
- Common Nigerians facing legal situations (landlord disputes, police encounters, employment issues)
- Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) needing compliance guidance (business registration, tax, employment law)
- Anyone who wants to understand their rights but lacks legal training

**What is the problem?**
Nigerian laws are publicly available but practically inaccessible to non-lawyers. The language is archaic, dense, and assumes legal training. Citizens cannot understand their own rights and obligations.

**What's the impact?**
- People make uninformed decisions with legal consequences
- SMEs operate in non-compliance unknowingly
- Citizens don't know their rights during police encounters
- Tenants and employees are exploited due to ignorance
- Fear and helplessness when facing legal situations

## Current State

**How is this problem currently addressed?**

| Current Solution | Limitation |
|------------------|------------|
| Hire a lawyer | Expensive ($50-500+ per consultation), inaccessible to most Nigerians |
| Ask friends/family | Unreliable, often incorrect legal "advice" |
| Search Google | Returns raw legal text or foreign law, not Nigerian context |
| NigeriaLII | Comprehensive but academic interface, no simplification |
| gbolissimo apps | Raw legal text, targeted at lawyers |
| OpenLawsNig | AI-powered but no plain language with practical examples |

**Key Pain Points:**
1. **Cost barrier** — Legal consultation is unaffordable for most
2. **Comprehension gap** — Available tools provide access, not understanding
3. **Discovery problem** — Users don't know which law applies to their situation
4. **Trust deficit** — Users can't verify if informal advice is correct
5. **Context missing** — No practical examples of how laws apply in real life

## Desired Future State

**What does success look like?**

A Nigerian facing a legal situation can:
1. **Describe their scenario** in plain language ("My landlord wants to evict me")
2. **Discover relevant laws** without knowing legal terminology
3. **Understand the law** in simple, clear language
4. **See practical examples** that mirror their situation
5. **Know their options** and when to seek professional help
6. **Verify information** through cited sources

**How will users' lives improve?**
- Confidence when dealing with authorities (police, landlords, employers)
- Informed business decisions for SMEs
- Reduced anxiety around legal situations
- Empowerment through knowledge
- Cost savings from not needing lawyers for basic legal literacy

## Problem Scope

### In Scope
- Federal Nigerian laws (Constitution, Criminal Code, CAMA, Labour Act, Tenancy, FIRS)
- Plain language explanations with practical examples
- Scenario-based discovery ("I'm dealing with...")
- Web-first platform with PWA capabilities
- AI-powered explanations with source citations
- Strong disclaimers (not legal advice)

### Out of Scope (MVP)
- State-specific laws (varies across 36 states)
- Case law and legal precedents
- Lawyer matching or referral services
- Document preparation or generation
- Live consultation features
- Nigerian language translations (Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, Pidgin)

## Impact of Not Solving

**If this problem remains unsolved:**

1. **Individual harm** — Nigerians continue making uninformed legal decisions, facing exploitation and injustice
2. **Economic impact** — SMEs fail due to compliance issues they didn't understand
3. **Social impact** — Distrust in legal systems grows; informal "justice" preferred
4. **Democratic deficit** — Citizens can't exercise rights they don't understand
5. **Market gap remains** — Competitors continue serving lawyers, not citizens

**Quantifying the impact:**
- 200M+ Nigerians with limited access to legal understanding
- 40M+ MSMEs operating with uncertain compliance
- High incidence of tenant exploitation, employment abuse, police misconduct

## Key Assumptions

| Assumption | Risk if Invalid | Validation Method |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Nigerians want to understand laws, not just access them | Core value prop fails | User interviews, landing page test |
| AI can reliably explain Nigerian law in plain language | Product quality compromised | Prototype with law students |
| Users will trust AI-generated explanations with disclaimers | Low adoption | Beta testing, feedback loops |
| Mobile web (PWA) reaches target audience effectively | Platform choice wrong | Analytics, user research |
| Federal laws cover most common citizen scenarios | Incomplete coverage | Usage analytics, gap analysis |
| Freemium model can sustain the product | Business model fails | Willingness-to-pay research |
| Legal text can be sourced reliably (NigeriaLII, PLAC) | Content acquisition blocked | Early partnership outreach |
