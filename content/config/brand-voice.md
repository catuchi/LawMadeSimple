## Language Rules

### Plain English
- Use simple words over complex ones
- Define legal terms when you must use them
- Keep sentences short (under 20 words ideal)

| Notwithstanding | Even though |
| Aforementioned | This/That |
| Shall | Will/Must |
| Hereinafter | From now on |

### Pidgin English
Light Pidgin is acceptable for emphasis or relatability, but:
- Don't overdo it (max 1-2 Pidgin phrases per post)
- Ensure meaning is clear without Pidgin knowledge
- Use for hooks, not for explaining the law itself

**Acceptable:** "Landlord wan increase rent? E no work like that o!"
**Followed by:** "Under Lagos Tenancy Law, rent increases require proper notice..."

### Nigerian Context
- Use Nigerian examples (Lagos traffic, market scenarios, Danfo)
- Reference Nigerian institutions (SARS, EFCC, FIRS)
- Use Naira amounts, Nigerian timelines
