## Trending Hashtag Guidelines

### When to Use Trending Hashtags
- Only when genuinely relevant to legal topic
- When we have valuable insight to add
- When the trend relates to rights/law

### When NOT to Use
- Just to get visibility (hashtag hijacking)
- When connection to law is forced
- Political hashtags (unless directly about legal rights)
- Tragedy-related hashtags (insensitive)

### How to Evaluate
1. Is there a genuine legal angle?
2. Can we add educational value?
3. Will our audience find it helpful?
4. Could it backfire or seem tone-deaf?

## Hashtag Placement

### Single Tweets
Place hashtags at the end:
```
[Tweet content]

#LawMadeSimple #TenantRights
```

### Threads
- First tweet: No hashtags (maximize hook space)
- Middle tweets: No hashtags
- Final tweet: Include all relevant hashtags

### Maximum per Post
- Single tweet: 3-4 hashtags
- Thread final tweet: 4-5 hashtags
- Never more than 5 (looks spammy)
