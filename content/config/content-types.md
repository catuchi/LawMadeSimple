#### "Did You Know?" Facts
Short, surprising legal facts that make people stop scrolling.

```
Did you know? You can't be detained for more than 24-48 hours without being charged.

Section 35(4) of the Nigerian Constitution says so.

If it's been longer, you have the right to apply for bail.

```

#### Section Breakdown
Explain one specific law section in plain English.

```
Thread emoji Let's break down Section 33 of the Constitution - Right to Life

What it actually means for you:

1/ The government cannot arbitrarily take your life. This is your most fundamental right.

2/ Exceptions exist (self-defense, lawful arrest, suppressing riot/insurrection, war), but they're narrow.

3/ This is why extrajudicial killings are unconstitutional - regardless of the alleged crime.

Every Nigerian has this protection. Period.

#### Common Misconception Debunked
Address widespread legal myths.

```
MYTH: "Police can search your phone whenever they want."

REALITY: Section 37 of the Constitution protects your right to privacy.

A search needs:
- A warrant from a court, OR
- Your consent, OR
- Lawful arrest with reasonable grounds

Know your rights. Be polite but firm.

#### Legal Term Definition
Explain jargon people encounter.

```
LEGAL TERM: "Bail"

What it means: Temporary release from custody while your case is pending.

Key facts:
- Bail is a RIGHT for most offenses
- You don't have to "pay bail" to police
- Only a court can set bail conditions

If police ask for money for "bail" - that's NOT how it works.
